# Train-Management
It is a simple train management system project created using basic python and it is a beginner level based project . I have imported one module named 'pnr' in this project.
It is basically a menu driven program .
It inclues three choices -viewing all trains,searching all trains,booking seats
We have created three different functions to perform above mentioned task
